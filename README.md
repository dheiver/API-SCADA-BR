Anomaly Detection API
This API can be used to detect anomalies in data. The API receives a JSON object as input, which contains the data as a list of numbers. The API then uses the detect_anomalies function to detect anomalies in the data and returns the list of anomalies as a JSON object.

To use the API, you can simply run the app.run() command in a Python interpreter. Once the API is in running, you can use a tool like curl or Postman to send requests to the API.

Parameters of the API
The API accepts two parameters:

data: A JSON object that contains the data as a list of numbers.
contamination: A number that represents the percentage of data that are expected to be anomalies. The value defaults to 0.05.
Example of use
The following example shows how to use the API to detect anomalies in data:

import requests

data = [120, 130, 140, 150, 160]
contamination = 0.05

url = "http://localhost:5000/detect_anomalies"

payload = {
"data": data,
"contamination": contamination
}

response = requests.post(url, json=payload)

anomalies = response.json()

print(anomalies)

The example above will return a list of anomalies, which are the values in the data that are considered to be anomalies.

Using the API on GitHub
The API can be used on GitHub to detect anomalies in data. To do this, you can create a new repository on GitHub and add the API code to the repository. You can then use the API to detect anomalies in data and take the appropriate measures.

For more information on how to use the API on GitHub, please refer to the GitHub documentation.

Future improvements
The API can be improved in a number of ways, including:

Adding support for other types of data, such as text, images, and videos.
Adding support for other methods of anomaly detection, such as analysis of trend, analysis of standard deviation, and analysis of cluster.
Adding support for visualization of data.
Adding support for reporting.
