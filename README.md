# Anomaly Detection API

This is a Flask-based API that provides anomaly detection using various methods like Isolation Forest, Local Outlier Factor (LOF), and One-Class SVM. The API takes input data and a contamination value as parameters and returns detected anomalies.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Flask
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- scikit-learn

You can install the required dependencies using pip:

```
pip install flask numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
```

### Running the API

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies as mentioned in the "Prerequisites" section.
3. Start the Flask server:

```
python app.py
```

The API will run on `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

## Usage

To detect anomalies, send a POST request to the `/detect_anomalies` endpoint with the following JSON payload:

```
{
  "data": [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100],
  "contamination": 0.1
}
```

- `data`: A list of numeric values for anomaly detection.
- `contamination`: The proportion of anomalies expected in the data.

The API will return a JSON response with the detected anomalies:

```
{
  "anomalies": [80, 90, 100]
}
```

## Methods Used for Anomaly Detection

1. IQR (Interquartile Range) Method: It identifies anomalies using the IQR method.
2. Isolation Forest: An ensemble method for anomaly detection.
3. Local Outlier Factor (LOF): A local density-based method for anomaly detection.
4. One-Class SVM: A support vector machine-based method for anomaly detection.
